# Application and Payment Status State Machine

## Status Definitions

### Application Status
- `submitted`: Initial state when application is first submitted
- `processing`: Application is being processed after payment
- `completed`: Service is completed (manual state change only)
- `cancelled`: Application cancelled by user (not allowed if paid)

### Payment Status
- `pending`: Awaiting payment
- `paid`: Payment successful
- `expired`: Payment window expired
- `refunded`: Payment refunded

## State Transition Rules

### Automatic Transitions
1. Initial Submission
   - Application: `submitted`
   - Payment: `pending`

2. Successful Payment (Stripe webhook)
   - Application: `processing`
   - Payment: `paid`

3. Payment Expiration (System task)
   - Application: `submitted`
   - Payment: `expired`

4. Refund (Stripe webhook)
   - Application: Remains `processing`
   - Payment: `refunded`

### Manual Transitions
1. Service Completion (Staff only)
   - Application: `completed`
   - Payment: Must be `paid`

2. User Cancellation
   - Application: `cancelled`
   - Payment: Cannot be `paid`

## Constraints
- Only paid applications can be marked as completed
- Cancelled status is not allowed for paid applications
- All state changes should be logged with timestamp
- Payment status `pending` allows retry payment
- Refunded applications remain active in `processing` state

## Implementation Notes
- State transitions should trigger appropriate notifications
- Each state change should be recorded in audit logs
- Stripe webhook handles payment status updates
- Manual state changes require staff authorization
