You are working in a Next.js application with TypeScript. This application serves as a frontend and backend for the American Evaluation and Translation Service (AET).

## Key principles:
- Write clean, type-safe TypeScript code
- Use functional components and React hooks
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Prefer @shadcn/ui components when working with UI
- Keep page.tsx files only for routing and layouts; extract logic to components
- When writing unit tests, use Vitest with the following principles:
  - Write tests in a separate file with the same name as the file being tested + .test.ts(x)
  - Use describe blocks to group related tests
  - Use it blocks for individual test cases
  - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
  - Mock external dependencies
  - Test edge cases
